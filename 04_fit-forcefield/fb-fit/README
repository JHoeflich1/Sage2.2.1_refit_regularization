I dont know if I did something wrong, but just submitting the `sbatch create-fb-inputs.py' does not reacte the compressed targets folder that is required in the master FB submission, you can either make one by `tar -czf targets.tar.gz targets` or if you know you are training on the same data (as in this case) I just copied the targets.tar.gz folder from the sage.2.2.1-sdata-core folder
